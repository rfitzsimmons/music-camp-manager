# [Music Camp Manager](https://github.com/rfitzsimmons/music-camp-manager)
An interactive website for registration and administration of a multi-session camp.
# Code Example
 TBD
# Motivation
A music camp that regularly attend uses some pretty primitive technology to collect registrations and manage the activities during the camp sessions.  My goal is to help the camp use web technology to automate the registration/payment process, gather registration data into a web-accessable database that can be viewed and modified by the camp administrator and director.  The administrative interface will be a dashboard paradigm and the registration process is intended to integrate with Wordpress as a plugin or shortcode.
# Software Stack
